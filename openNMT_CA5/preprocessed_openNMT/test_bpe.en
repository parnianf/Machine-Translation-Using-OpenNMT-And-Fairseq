the group said pro gad@@ ha@@ fi forces used ta@@ wer@@ gh@@ a as a base for attacks on mis@@ r@@ ata and the surrounding area from march until august .
many ta@@ wer@@ gh@@ ans supported the 42 year rul@@ er , whose regime claimed that libyan opposition fighters would en@@ sla@@ ve ta@@ wer@@ gh@@ ans if they took power , human rights watch said .
the group said ta@@ wer@@ gh@@ a once a town of 30 , 000 residents is now abandoned , with some areas r@@ ans@@ acked and burned .

to hide the fact that they are losing territory , support , and the will to fight , our common enemy continues to employ suicide attackers to kill innocent afghan fathers , mothers , sons and daughters , as well as the coalition forces who have volunte@@ ered to protect them .
the u .s . led war in afghanistan marked its 10@@ th year earlier this month having passed two major mil@@ est@@ ones .
the taliban has been forced out of power and osama bin laden is dead .
but afghanistan has been hit by a wave of high profile attacks in recent months that have je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the peace negotiations .

wednesday 's agreement , reached in br@@ us@@ sels , will sl@@ ash greek debt , rec@@ ap@@ it@@ ali@@ ze european banks and more than double the european union ba@@ il@@ out fund 's resources to handle future sovere@@ ign de@@ faults .
it 's great news that we 've got an agreement , said de@@ ut@@ sc@@ he bank econom@@ ist gil@@ les mo@@ ec .

the two technology firms are not the only ones expl@@ oring the area .
less well known companies , including qu@@ al@@ com@@ m and extreme reality 3 d , have also acted to secure tou@@ ch@@ less control pat@@ ent rights .

it suggests in@@ fr@@ ared , op@@ tical and other sen@@ sors would be used to det@@ ect the movements .
one use could be to transfer a video from a mobile phone by fl@@ icking it to a television .

in early april , jon cor@@ z@@ ine was in a tough spot .
m@@ f global , the company he had run for the previous year , was about to post a fourth quarter loss , mar@@ king its fourth suc@@ ces@@ sive fiscal year of red ink .
for the former gol@@ d@@ man s@@ ach@@ s chief , it was a set@@ back to his efforts to turn m@@ f global around .
he needed his traders to step up their game , and he called a group of them into a conference room at its man@@ h@@ att@@ an headquarters to lay out the plan .
he had just announced a plan for the bank to boost trading risk by holding more assets on its books , both to help customers and to bet on markets .
the trading , particularly in debt from troubled eur@@ o zone nations in the past year , has instead driven the firm to the br@@ ink of collapse , making it possibly the most prominent u .s . casu@@ alty yet from the eur@@ o zone crisis .
it has also badly hurt cor@@ z@@ ine 's business image , and reduced the former new jer@@ sey governor 's chances of ever making a political com@@ e@@ back .
cor@@ z@@ ine could not be reached for comment and m@@ f global declined comment .
the firm was in talks with possible bu@@ yers on sunday , though sources said all options were on the table as it had hi@@ red re@@ struc@@ turing and ban@@ kru@@ pt@@ cy advis@@ ers .
m@@ f global 's fate has raised questions about whether the 6@@ 4 year old cor@@ z@@ ine 's aff@@ in@@ ity for risk taking has finally caught up to him after a career that took him to the top ec@@ hel@@ ons of wall street and then into politics as a u .s . sen@@ ator and to the new jer@@ sey state governor 's man@@ sion .
cor@@ z@@ ine still has supporters on wall street who argue he was caught in a perfect storm but his de@@ trac@@ tors argue there have long been signs that cor@@ z@@ ine could take imp@@ rud@@ ent risks .
they point to gol@@ d@@ man s@@ ach@@ s major trading losses under his watch in 199@@ 4 , or when he sust@@ ained serious injur@@ ies in 2007 as a pass@@ enger in a spe@@ eding sports utility vehicle while not wearing a se@@ at@@ belt .
he said in a call with analysts last tuesday that m@@ f global sought to take advantage of dis@@ loc@@ ations in the sovere@@ ign debt market by buying what it saw as relatively low risk paper .
in inter@@ views with more than a dozen former employees and competitors , a por@@ tra@@ it emer@@ ges of cor@@ z@@ ine struggling to trans@@ form the firm by ram@@ ping up risk .
his strategic shift did not sit well with some employees , and came at a time when credit rat@@ ings agencies and financial markets are very un@@ for@@ giving of high risk strategies .
the business model is n 't what it used to be , said pat@@ r@@ ick ar@@ b@@ or , a former chairman of the chic@@ ago board of trade and a long time executive of a clearing bro@@ ker .
cor@@ z@@ ine could have sh@@ run@@ k m@@ f global 's balance sheet or re@@ structured .
with the support of the board which in a recent regul@@ atory fil@@ ing appl@@ au@@ ded cor@@ z@@ ine 's choice he embar@@ ked on the strategy of trans@@ forming the company into what the fil@@ ing described as a commodities and capital markets focused investment bank .
while before , m@@ f global would link bu@@ yers up with sel@@ lers , or place trad@@ es on an exchange , the company would now hold an inv@@ ent@@ ory of sec@@ ur@@ ities , potenti@@ ally sitting on positions for longer , and be@@ tting on their price movements .
carrying inv@@ ent@@ ories usually requires more capital .
but it seemed like a good move at a time when larger banks such as gol@@ d@@ man were being forced to limit their risk taking because of increased regulation , according to a company pres@@ entation .
bra@@ d ab@@ el@@ ow , a former gol@@ d@@ man col@@ league who served as his chief of staff and treas@@ u@@ rer during his new jer@@ sey gu@@ ber@@ nat@@ or@@ ial term , was named president and chief operating officer .
other senior people joined , including ci@@ ti@@ group fixed income veter@@ an ric@@ hard mo@@ ore in london who became the firm 's european head .
cor@@ z@@ ine also hi@@ red he@@ dge fund veter@@ an mun@@ ir ja@@ ver@@ i as global head of trading , and to over@@ see pro@@ pri@@ etary trading .
in an environment with limited capital and limited distribution , the game is about sing@@ les and dou@@ bles , because if you go for a home run and miss , you might not live to play another day , said one m@@ f trad@@ er who worked before and during cor@@ z@@ ine 's re@@ ign .
there was an enormous mis@@ understanding of the firm 's assets and reach , he added .
some sales staff complained that the firm was short on risk management , something companies like gol@@ d@@ man pride themselves on .
inter@@ nec@@ ine squ@@ ab@@ bles among traders , sal@@ es@@ people and ban@@ kers are common at an investment bank , particularly when massive changes in strategy create internal win@@ ners and lo@@ s@@ ers .
but to cor@@ z@@ ine 's cri@@ tics , his jump into sectors such as european debt invest@@ ing brought serious risk .
as of october 25 , the company had about $ 6 .3 billion of european sovere@@ ign debt from some of the eur@@ o zone 's more peri@@ ph@@ eral and troubled countries , including italy , spain , por@@ tu@@ g@@ al , ireland and bel@@ gi@@ um , though not greece .
but m@@ f global 's overall capital levels leave it with little margin for error .
the company 's book equ@@ ity comp@@ ares to an eye pop@@ ping $ 41 .0@@ 5 billion of assets , which means if the value of m@@ f global 's assets falls more than about 3 percent , the company has wi@@ ped out the whole of its equ@@ ity cus@@ hi@@ on and is out of business .
even a 1 percent decline could leave it dang@@ er@@ ously under@@ capit@@ alized .
the firm 's le@@ verage was on p@@ ar with le@@ hman brothers , even if its assets were sa@@ fer .
the company insisted it was being prud@@ ent with its risk taking .
in its most recently quar@@ terly pres@@ entation last week , it argued it had low levels of il@@ liquid assets , known as level 3 assets .
it pointed out that european sovere@@ ign investments are relatively safe , because they mature relatively soon by the end of 2012 and the european financial stability facility back@@ stops these countries through mid 2013 .
i can 't speak to m@@ f global , but if he applied the same process there as he did when was conducting the affairs of government , i have to say he is a though@@ tful , careful and prud@@ ent busin@@ es@@ sp@@ er@@ son , said st@@ even gol@@ d@@ man , who served as cor@@ z@@ ine 's commis@@ sion@@ er of banking and insurance in new jer@@ sey from 2006 to 2009 and is now a partner at law firm k@@ ram@@ er levin n@@ af@@ tal@@ is & amp ; fran@@ kel .
decisions were never made from the hi@@ p .
deplo@@ ying $ 6@@ 2 million of his ip@@ o boun@@ ty , he campaig@@ ned as a democr@@ at dark horse candidate in primary and general elections for a u .s . senate seat from new jer@@ sey .
despite ref@@ using to release his income tax recor@@ ds and g@@ aff@@ es such as when he jo@@ ked about it@@ ali@@ ans who make cement shoes and were def@@ ended by jewish lawyers , he won the election .
after one term in which he made only a mod@@ est number of head@@ lines , cor@@ z@@ ine in 2005 successfully campaig@@ ned to become new jer@@ sey governor .
he lost his campaign for re@@ election in 2009 to republican ch@@ ris christi@@ e and a few months later answered the call from flowers , whose private equ@@ ity firm j . c . flowers had invest@@ ed $ 300 million in m@@ f global in 2008 , and joined the firm .
while he has many fans on wall street and beyond , some say his business and political care@@ ers are un@@ likely to recover from this latest blow .
whatever the outcome of talks over a sale or a re@@ struc@@ turing few see much of a role for cor@@ z@@ ine in m@@ f global 's future .
but the q@@ ant@@ as union ; which has been em@@ bro@@ iled in a year long labor dispute pun@@ c@@ tu@@ ated by rolling wal@@ k@@ outs ; was caught flat foo@@ ted , as was the government of austr@@ alian prime minister juli@@ a gill@@ ard and , of course , tens of thousands of q@@ ant@@ as passengers worldwide .
it 's a mani@@ ac@@ al over@@ reaction , said ric@@ hard wo@@ od@@ ward , vice president of the austr@@ alian and international pil@@ ots union .
i think al@@ an jo@@ y@@ ce is destroying the brand of q@@ ant@@ as ; he 's holding the passengers for ran@@ som as he black@@ ma@@ ils the government of australia .
austr@@ alian assistant treas@@ u@@ rer bill shor@@ ten lab@@ eled the decision a high handed am@@ bush .
we 're conscious the austr@@ alian economy has been put at great risk of damage due to the strike , shor@@ ten said .
labor relations tribun@@ al fair work australia agreed , or@@ dering an end to the labor dispute to avoid significant damage to the tourism industry .
jo@@ y@@ ce , a native of ireland , has been ce@@ o of q@@ ant@@ as since 2008 , after a five year ten@@ ure as ce@@ o of je@@ t@@ star .
jo@@ y@@ ce has been pushing a re@@ struc@@ turing that would put more focus on exp@@ anding its budget air@@ line operations , start a new premi@@ um service outside of australia and cut some long ha@@ ul routes .
you will remember that early in the 2008 presidential campaign , bar@@ ack obama sig@@ nal@@ ed that he was going to have a different foreign policy than george bush and he chose as his example , iran .
he argued that simply pres@@ sur@@ ing the country was not a policy and obama offered to talk to iran 's leaders .
well , two years into his presid@@ ency , obama 's iran policy looks a lot like george w . bush 's pressure and more pressure .
the p@@ uni@@ tive tac@@ tics have paid off in some measure .
iran faces economic problems .
but they are also having a per@@ ver@@ se impact on the country , as i witnessed last week .
the sanctions are sti@@ fl@@ ing growth , though not as much as one might imagine .
so the basic effect has been to weak@@ en civil society and strengthen the state the opposite of what we should be trying to do in that country .
by some estimates , iran 's revolutionary guard the hard line element of the armed forces , supported by the supreme leader , now controls 40 % of the economy .
in fact , what is our goal ?
is it to over@@ throw the iranian regime ?
is it to make it ble@@ ed until it gives up its nuclear program ?
a wh@@ oles@@ ale revolution continues to strike me as a distant prospect .
the regime still has some domestic support , and it uses a mix of religious authority , pat@@ ron@@ age and force quite effectively .
and we keep for@@ getting the in@@ convenient fact that , even if the regime changed , the nuclear energy program which is popular as an expression of iranian nation@@ alism and power will continue .
even the leaders of the green movement strongly support that program .
obama should return to his original approach and test the ir@@ an@@ ians to see if there is any room for dialogue and agreement .
eng@@ aging with iran , putting its nuclear program under some kind of super@@ vision and finding areas of common interest such as afghanistan would all be important goals .
it might not work the iranian regime is divided and often paraly@@ zed itself but it 's worth trying .
strategic engagement with an adver@@ sary can go hand in hand with a policy that encour@@ ages change in that country .
that 's how washington dealt with the soviet union and china in the 19@@ 70 s and 80 s .
iran is a country of 80 million people , educated and dynamic .
it s@@ its a@@ stri@@ de a crucial part of the world .
it can not be sanc@@ tioned and pressed down forever .
it is the last great civilization to sit outside the global order .
we need a strategy that comb@@ ines pressure with a path to bring iran in from the cold .

braz@@ il 's government has loudly pro@@ claimed a deal it says is worth $ 12 billion for ta@@ i@@ wan@@ ese technology giant fo@@ x@@ con@@ n to produce i@@ pad@@ s and build a whole new industry based around scre@@ ens used in an array of consumer electron@@ ics from smar@@ t@@ phones to tel@@ ev@@ isi@@ ons .
but the in@@ famous braz@@ il cost shor@@ th@@ and for the bure@@ au@@ cr@@ acy and high taxes that pl@@ ag@@ ue business in the country is already over@@ sha@@ do@@ wing the deal , complic@@ ating negotiations with fo@@ x@@ con@@ n over the broad@@ er investment plan .
the likely need for large state sub@@ sidi@@ zed loans to l@@ ure fo@@ x@@ con@@ n also re@@ vi@@ ves concerns about the state 's heavy hand in braz@@ il 's economy .
yet cri@@ tics say braz@@ il 's shallow labor pool and poor infrastructure make it ill prepared to make the lea@@ p to high end work and that it risks being stuck at the low end assem@@ bling components designed and made elsewhere .
at first , fo@@ x@@ con@@ n will have to fly in most of the key components such as sem@@ ic@@ on@@ duc@@ tors , mo@@ dem@@ s and scre@@ ens from china , as braz@@ il attempts to raise its ability to produce more of them loc@@ ally .
we are selling our market very che@@ ap@@ ly , giving tax incentives for a company to come and produce something that is already developed in the world market , said jo@@ ao maria de oli@@ ve@@ ir@@ a , a research@@ er at the government linked institute for applied economic research , or i@@ pe@@ a .
it 's not something that ad@@ ds much value and it w@@ o n 't leave much here .
the amount of value added to apple products by fo@@ x@@ con@@ n 's approximately one million workers in china is a mere $ 10 or so per device , according to a study by researchers at the university of california , ir@@ v@@ ine .
braz@@ il has cut taxes and duties on tab@@ let production in a move that should reduce the re@@ tail price by about a third and is pha@@ sing in production requirements to fo@@ ster a local components industry .
separ@@ ately , it is in talks with fo@@ x@@ con@@ n on a package of incentives , including priority customs access , more tax break@@ s and sub@@ sidi@@ zed loans from state development bank b@@ n@@ des to secure the bigger investment in high end scre@@ ens .
the fo@@ x@@ con@@ n factory near steve jobs road is ru@@ mor@@ ed by braz@@ il@@ ian media to already be producing i@@ phones and is expected to start chur@@ ning out ip@@ ad tab@@ lets by december for sale to braz@@ il 's growing middle class .
the company , whose main listed vehicle is h@@ on hai prec@@ ision industry co ltd , has already hi@@ red more than 1 , 000 people in jun@@ di@@ ai , a medium sized city an hour away from sa@@ o pa@@ ul@@ o , to work at a new plant .
tab@@ let sales in braz@@ il will jump to 4@@ 50 , 000 this year from 10@@ 5 , 000 1@@ 10 , 000 last year , according to consul@@ ting firm id@@ c , sur@@ ging to above 1 million next year .
that is significant growth but the 60 percent of braz@@ il@@ ian house@@ holds without a computer w@@ o n 't necessarily rush out to buy tab@@ lets , cau@@ tioned j@@ ose mar@@ ti@@ m ju@@ ac@@ ida , an analyst with the company .
last week , fare@@ ed zak@@ ar@@ ia traveled to iran to interview president mahmoud ahmad@@ ine@@ jad .
fare@@ ed 's trip occurred just weeks after the united states accused iran of plo@@ tting to assass@@ inate the saudi ambassador to the u .s . and just as president obama announced the up@@ coming withdraw@@ al of u .s . troops from iraq .
fare@@ ed considered the former a sign of iran 's milit@@ ar@@ ization and the latter a strategic bo@@ on to tehran .
fare@@ ed was in iran at a time when its leadership is locked in an internal power struggle with president ahmad@@ ine@@ jad up against supreme leader ay@@ at@@ ol@@ lah kha@@ men@@ e@@ i .
this has led one gps analyst to ask whether ahmad@@ ine@@ jad will effectively be iran 's last president .
and as the win@@ ds of change swe@@ ep the arab world , they seem to stop at iran 's borders .
here are some reasons why there has n 't been an iranian spring ' .
but clearly dis@@ content bu@@ b@@ bles within .
just look at this sur@@ prising be@@ st@@ selling book in tehran .
fare@@ ed found iran sur@@ pris@@ ingly clean and its urban women relatively liber@@ ated .
he spoke with analysts in iran who explained why , despite what we@@ ster@@ ners might expect , ahmad@@ ine@@ jad is actually a re@@ former when compared with the ay@@ at@@ ol@@ lah .
and fare@@ ed saw the effect of sanctions up close .
the interview with president ahmad@@ ine@@ jad was striking as well .
the president offered a rather unique interpre@@ tation of zi@@ on@@ ism , proposed an odd political experim@@ ent and def@@ ended his country 's soft policies toward syria .
as expected , he denied iran 's nuclear weapons ambi@@ tions and condemned the united states for my@@ ri@@ ad alleged wr@@ on@@ gs .
and ahmad@@ ine@@ jad argued that nato 's mission in libya exac@@ er@@ b@@ ated the conflict .
we 've been paying a lot of attention to iran over the past few weeks .
you can read all our coverage here .
in the coming days , we 'll be pres@@ enting some broad@@ er analy@@ tical pieces to make sense of it all .
i inv@@ ite you to join us in sharing your impres@@ sions and analy@@ ses below .
i was in saudi arabia when king fa@@ h@@ d died in 2005 .
there was genuine re@@ mor@@ se among saud@@ is young and old at the passing of the king .
por@@ tra@@ its of the king covered car windows for weeks a spon@@ tan@@ eous and un@@ prece@@ den@@ ted out@@ burst of saudi national grief .
there was also hope that the new king , abdullah , would help bring saudi arabia into the twenty first century .
that dream ended yesterday with the appointment of prince n@@ ay@@ ef bin abdul aziz as crown prince , or de fac@@ to rul@@ er of saudi arabia as king abdullah continues to under@@ go hospital treatment for his dec@@ lining health condition .
in the corrid@@ ors of power in washington , dc , and london there was some relief that prince n@@ ay@@ ef , as expected , had become crown prince .
in contrast , young saud@@ is on twit@@ ter , saudi democracy activists and voc@@ al women were filled with fore@@ bo@@ ding as to what lies ahead in their country .
granted , n@@ ay@@ ef has been a vo@@ ci@@ fer@@ ous enemy of al qaeda elements inside saudi arabia and elim@@ inated hundreds of oper@@ atives , while arre@@ sting thousands since 2003 .
but this was not because he opposed ji@@ ha@@ di ideology or islam@@ ist thinking .
his public attacks on the muslim brotherhood come not because he diff@@ ers with their brand of sal@@ afi islam , but because they seek to under@@ mine the house of sa@@ ud .
the general conference for un@@ es@@ co gets under@@ way in paris monday when the u .@@ n . agency is expected to vote whether or not to accept a palestinian bid for full member@@ ship .
in september , palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas made a bid for the united nations to recognize a palestinian state .
and un@@ es@@ co is the first agency that the palestinians have sought to join .
any recognition of palestine as a member state would not only je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze the hope for a resu@@ mption of direct israeli palestinian negotiations , but would end@@ anger the united states contribution to un@@ es@@ co , said an october 13 letter signed by members of the house appropri@@ ations sub@@ committee on state and foreign operations , which appropri@@ ates un@@ es@@ co 's u .s . funding .
this is consistent with current law and i will consider additional actions as needed , she said this month .
there are consequences for short cutting the process , not only for the palestinians , but for our long@@ standing relationship with the united nations .
she was referring to a provision of 22 us@@ c 2@@ 8@@ 7 e which states : no funds author@@ ized to be appropri@@ ated by this act or any other act shall be available for the united nations or any speci@@ alized agency there@@ of which accor@@ ds the palestine liberation organization the same standing as member states .
a humanitarian crisis lo@@ oms in th@@ ail@@ and after the worst floo@@ ds in decades left parts of bang@@ k@@ ok and other areas of the country sub@@ mer@@ ged , relief agencies warned sunday .
bang@@ k@@ ok 's central business district has so far avo@@ ided major floo@@ ding , but many of the areas nearby are chest or wa@@ ist deep in water , forcing residents to flee their homes .
the th@@ ai government has set up more than 1 , 7@@ 00 shel@@ ters across the country , where more than 1@@ 13 , 000 people have taken refu@@ ge since floo@@ ding began in july after heavy mon@@ soon ra@@ ins .
more than 3@@ 70 people have died , and char@@ ities working in the country have warned of the risk of water and insec@@ t bor@@ ne diseases such as di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , den@@ gue f@@ ever and mal@@ ar@@ ia in the coming days and weeks .
th@@ ai officials warned residents in the capital to be vi@@ gil@@ ant and expect disru@@ ptions with electricity and ta@@ p water .
unicef said it was providing 20 , 000 mosqu@@ i@@ to ne@@ ts , and han@@ ding out 20 , 000 p@@ am@@ ph@@ lets expl@@ aining how to stay safe and healthy in flood hit regions .
the red cross said it had provided more than 130 , 000 relief k@@ its , and 120 , 000 p@@ acks of bott@@ led water , but representatives in bang@@ k@@ ok said they were concerned at the lack of food and drinking water in communities isol@@ ated by the floo@@ d@@ waters .
officials in the capital have warned residents to expect interru@@ ptions to electricity and ta@@ p water supplies .
the me@@ tro@@ pol@@ it@@ an water@@ works authority said it had reduced the amount of ta@@ p water proc@@ essed for residents from 9@@ 00 , 000 to 400 , 000 cubic meters per day , because of high al@@ ga@@ e coun@@ ts at one of its plants .
the prime minister said authorities would speed up the process of dra@@ ining water into bang@@ k@@ ok 's can@@ als and into the sea , raising hopes that water levels in the city could start to s@@ ink .
however , the government has warned it may take more than a month for the floo@@ ds to rec@@ ed@@ e .
co@@ ch@@ ran@@ e said the country still faced a variety of threats , including strong curren@@ ts , disease and even cro@@ co@@ d@@ ile and sn@@ ake attacks .
but he said it was vital that authorities and char@@ ities also start to look beyond the immediate dang@@ ers .
three afghan security guards and one afghan civilian were killed in the attack , said gen . ham@@ id war@@ da@@ g , a local commander of the afghan national army .
in addition , two assa@@ il@@ ants were shot to death by afghan security forces , the general said .
war@@ da@@ g said a truck full of explosives blew up in front of the international relief and development office .
the explosion was followed by gun@@ fire .
some armed taliban have taken position at the building at this moment and are fighting back , war@@ da@@ g said monday morning .
a few hours later , war@@ da@@ g said the shooting had stopped , but a search for gun@@ men continued inside the building .
international relief and development speci@@ ali@@ zes in helping areas affected by conflict and war recover and improve , according to its website .
kandahar province has seen a r@@ ash of recent violence .
on thursday , insurgents launched attacks on a provincial reconstruction team base and a military out@@ post , afghan and nato officials said .
insurgents fired small guns and rocket prop@@ elled gre@@ n@@ ades r@@ p@@ gs toward the provincial reconstruction team , said a@@ gh@@ a l@@ ali , a member of the kandahar provincial council .
officials killed two of the attackers , according to a regional police chief .
and on october 22 , three u .s . service members were killed when an improv@@ ised explosive device blew up near their assa@@ ult force .
after seven months of an aer@@ ial bombing campaign that helped de@@ pose long@@ time rul@@ er mo@@ amm@@ ar gad@@ ha@@ fi , nato officially ends its mission in libya on monday .
nato 's move comes after the united nations security council last week res@@ cin@@ ded its march man@@ date for military intervention to protect civilians targeted during anti regime protests .
lib@@ y@@ ans have now liber@@ ated their country and they have trans@@ formed the region , said nato secretary general and@@ ers fo@@ gh ras@@ mus@@ sen on friday .
this is their victory .
our operation for libya will end on october 31 .
until then , together with our partners , we will continue to monitor the situation .
and if needed , we will continue to respond to threats to civilians , ras@@ mus@@ sen said .
we 're very concerned that , as we move forward , that the authorities make maximum effort to swi@@ f@@ tly form an inclu@@ sive government that in@@ corpor@@ ates all aspects of libyan society , and in which the rights of all libyan people are fully and thor@@ oughly respected , regardless of their gen@@ der , their religion , their region of origin , rice said after the security council vote last thursday .
all of the events that have taken place since february 2011 and the murder of gad@@ ha@@ fi , all of this means we are totally in our right to call upon the international criminal court , said mar@@ c@@ el c@@ ec@@ cal@@ di , a lawyer repres@@ enting the family said last week .
nato 's libya campaign began in march , after the security council adopted resolution 197@@ 3 , which imposed a no fly zone in the country 's air@@ space and author@@ ized member states to take measures to protect civilians .
the trial of former egyptian president ho@@ sn@@ i mubarak was put on hold for two months pen@@ ding a decision on whether to replace the judge , his lawyer told cnn on sunday .
the delay comes because attor@@ ne@@ ys for victims of the u@@ prising that top@@ pled mubarak obj@@ ected to the judge pre@@ si@@ ding over the case , said the lawyer , far@@ id el de@@ e@@ b .
the judge is not firm enough , said kh@@ aled abu bak@@ r , a lawyer repres@@ enting one of the victims .
he did not allow many of them into the court and did not give them enough time to ask their questions , especially in the testi@@ mony of general tan@@ ta@@ wi .
they face charges over the killing of protesters in the demonstrations that led mubarak to re@@ sign in february , and over corruption while in office .
lawyers repres@@ enting the families of the dead protesters pe@@ ti@@ tioned a higher court demanding a new panel of judges because of un@@ fair treatment of lawyers repres@@ enting civilians .
japan 's ministry of finance interv@@ ened in the currency market for the first time since august to weak@@ en the y@@ en , sending the currency down as much as 5 .1 per cent against the us dollar .
ju@@ n az@@ um@@ i , finance minister , confirmed that the bank of japan was acting on the m@@ of 's orders to halt the y@@ en 's spec@@ ul@@ ative rise , after the currency touched 75 .@@ 35 , a new post@@ war high , earlier in the day .
the japanese currency climbed last week even as the bo@@ j eas@@ ed monetary policy , increasing the size of its asset purchasing programme by 10 per cent , and in spite of economic data from the us that were mostly encouraging .
the action had an immediate effect , sending the y@@ en down to 7@@ 9 .@@ 49 .
mas@@ af@@ um@@ i y@@ am@@ am@@ o@@ to , chief currency strate@@ g@@ ist at bar@@ cla@@ ys capital , said the traditional cor@@ relation between the dollar / y@@ en rate and us japan yiel@@ d g@@ aps had broken down in recent weeks , sugg@@ est@@ ing that the direction of the currency was not being ste@@ ered by fundament@@ als .
to some extent , [ today 's action ] fil@@ ls the gap between the actual dollar / y@@ en level and the r@@ ational level suggested by yiel@@ d differ@@ enti@@ als , said y@@ uno@@ su@@ ke i@@ ke@@ da , head of f@@ x strategy at nom@@ ura .
still , the tim@@ ing of the move came as a surprise to some , given that the ni@@ k@@ ke@@ i index and y@@ en cro@@ sses had both been relatively steady .
this is likely to have been a single shot intervention .
repeated currency intervention is likely to be regarded as currency mani@@ pul@@ ation , which is not allowed under the g@@ 7 framework , said mr i@@ ke@@ da .
in recent cases of intervention , the government 's style has been minimum frequency , but maximum size , said mr y@@ am@@ am@@ o@@ to of bar@@ cap .
if today 's intervention stops the down@@ ward movement in dollar / y@@ en , there will be no follow through tomorrow , but it all depends on how the currency moves in later ses@@ sions .
nine americans , including four u .s . troops , were among those killed in a suicide bombing in afghanistan 's capital this weekend , a western diplom@@ at told cnn sunday .
saturday 's blast which also claimed the lives of two british civilians , a ko@@ so@@ v@@ o national and a canadian soldier occurred when a car p@@ acked with explosives struck an ar@@ mor@@ ed bus in a nato convoy , the diplom@@ at said .
authorities have not released identi@@ ties of the other victims .
a diplomatic source said the two british citizens who were killed were civilian contrac@@ tors working for is@@ a@@ f .
afghan president ham@@ id karzai offered his sympath@@ ies at a national security meeting sunday .
afghan people are gri@@ eved by the nato loss of lives and share the pain and sorrow with the families and friends of the troops killed , he said .
a taliban spokesman confirmed saturday 's attack in a text message , saying it killed 16 foreign soldiers , one civilian and injured many others .
taliban casu@@ alty coun@@ ts are often infl@@ ated ; there was no other reliable indication 16 foreig@@ ners were killed .
attackers fired rocket prop@@ elled gre@@ n@@ ades and small arms at coalition troops who were assist@@ ing afghan forces at the site of a land dispute , the statement said .
no is@@ a@@ f forces were injured or killed , the statement said .
the fighting er@@ up@@ ted after the taliban convinced members of a tribe that they should attack a convoy carrying government officials to rec@@ la@@ im their land , said ha@@ ji le@@ wan@@ i , a tribal elder in the province .
about 20 taliban insurgents and seven tribesmen were among the dead , he said .
also saturday , a gun@@ man wearing an afghan army uniform turned his weapon on coalition forces during training , killing three and w@@ ounding several others , is@@ a@@ f said .
the shoo@@ ter was killed in the incident in southern afghanistan .
