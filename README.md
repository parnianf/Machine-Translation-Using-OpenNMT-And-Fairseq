# Machine-Translation-Using-OpenNMT-And-Fairseq


In this project, we are going to examine neural network-based machine translation tools and also learn about the training process of a neural network-based machine translation model. We will use **OpenNMT** and **Fairseq**. There are different architectures for training sequence to sequence models. In this project, we intend to train a model based on transformer architecture.

#### Dataset
For the training and evaluation of the models of this project, a small part of the English-Persian `AFEC` corpus is considered, and the training, testing and validation data are included in the *data* folder. We want to train two neural network-based machine translation models with the help of this corpus.


#### Main topics discussed
* Preprocessing
* Explaining important parameters of OpenNMT and Fairseq.
* Implementing `BPE`
* Using OpenNMT & Fairseq
* Showing `Blue` result
