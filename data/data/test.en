yingluck shinawatra has to be proclaimed by the nation 's king before she can officially take office .
if king bhumibol adulyadej proclaims her , she will be the 28th prime minister in thai history .
yingluck won 296 votes in the nearly 500 - member parliament .
there is a lot more hard work to do in the future for the well - being of our sisters and brothers , the people of thailand , she said last month .
there are many things to accomplish to make reconciliation possible , paving the way for a solid foundation for a flourishing nation .
tensions between the democratic party and the pheu thai party , which reflect deep divisions within thai society , erupted last year , leading to a military crackdown .
more than 90 people were killed and hundreds were injured .
the danger was particularly pronounced at high tides .
several districts in bangkok - which barely sits above flood level - are facing serious flooding , including one tied to a break in a flood barrier at klong mahasawat , according to the mcot news agency .
the thai government has set up more than 1 , 700 shelters nationwide , and more than 113 , 000 people have sought refuge in them , including 10 , 000 in bangkok , according to gov . sukhumbhand paribatra .
government authorities are preparing to evacuate more people all across the municipality .
prime minister yingluck shinawatra said saturday that flood waters would likely reduce by the first week of november if relevant agencies control the drainage .
government officials have made preparations to rehabilitate public , agricultural and industrial sectors , the news agency reported .
the prime minister urged stores not to stockpile consumer goods - hoping this will address panic buying that residents said has led to a shortage of food and bottled water .
the metropolitan waterworks authority announced that it reduced the amount of tap water processed for residents from 900 , 000 to 400 , 000 cubic meters per day .
the reason is high algae counts at one plant that are affecting the filtering process , the utility said in a statement .
but the prime minister assured residents saturday tap water and electricity would be available , but with disruptions .
meanwhile , the ministry of public health transferred 280 of the capital 's 520 patients in severe condition to 22 hospitals upcountry , the news agency reported .
remaining patients will be taken to hospitals in other provinces , it said .
the floods , caused by monsoon rains that saturated rivers , have killed at least 373 people nationwide and affected more than 9.5 million people .
at least 21 people were killed in clashes countrywide , including 11 in homs , according to the local coordination committees ( lcc ) of syria , an opposition group that organizes and documents protests in syria .
four people were killed in hama and one each in hasaka , daraa , idlib , keseh , zabadany and deir ezzor , the lcc said .
the syrian observatory for human rights reported at least 10 civilian deaths in homs on saturday .
the fierce fighting has been ongoing between armed military defectors and loyalist forces , said rami abdel rahman , president of the london - based group .
for weeks , the military has parked tanks at the entrance to bab amer , a homs neighborhood known as the epicenter of anti - government activity , an activist told cnn saturday .
after the saturday morning crackdown , the military established new checkpoints and a much heavier presence , the activist said .
he said he heard jets overhead around 9 : 30 in the morning .
a few minutes later , tanks began firing into buildings and homes .
security forces also cracked down in other syrian cities , the lcc reported .
there was heavy presence of troops in parts of idlib and raids in deir ezzor .
armed army defectors ambushed a bus carrying syrian security forces as it traveled between two villages in idlib province , the syrian observatory said .
the group said 10 loyalists were killed and one defector died in clashes that broke out between the opposing groups after the ambush .
also saturday , the sunday telegraph published an interview with embattled syrian president bashar al - assad , which it said was his first with a western journalist since the start of the uprising seven months ago .
in it , the president warns western countries not to intervene in his country .
syria is the hub now in this region , said al - assad , the british newspaper reported .
it is the fault line , and if you play with the ground you will cause an earthquake .
do you want to see another afghanistan , or tens of afghanistans ?
any problem in syria will burn the whole region .
if the plan is to divide syria , that is to divide the whole region .
demonstrators also called on the united nations to impose a no - fly zone , naval blockade and other measures to protect syrian protesters .
security forces fatally shot 35 civilians during protests across the nation friday , the syrian observatory for human rights said .
at least 100 others were wounded and 500 arrested in several provinces , the group said .
u.n. secretary - general ban ki - moon condemned friday 's killings .
he said the deaths of more than 3 , 000 people killed since the start of the syrian uprising amounts to an alarming toll .
australian airline qantas remained grounded for a second day sunday , leaving tens of thousands of stranded passengers worldwide awaiting an independent watchdog 's decision in the labor dispute .
at sydney airport , columns of canceled illuminated the departure board .
throngs of weary passengers crowded the help desk to rebook with other airlines as suitcases lay scattered all over the floor .
in a statement , qantas pilots slammed the airline 's chief executive for grounding the entire fleet , saying it is unfair to passengers , shareholders and workers .
alan joyce obviously thinks qantas is his personal plaything to use in his high - stakes game against pilots and other workers , said richard woodward , the president of the australian and international pilots association .
union officials have accused the airline of planning to outsource ground jobs at a cost of thousands of australian jobs , and putting profits first .
pay and working conditions have also been at the center of the disputes .
the industrial action is aimed at ensuring qantas will not have enough funds to set up overseas operations that will jeopardize job security , union officials said .
my message to qantas , the employees and trade unions is : australians do want to see this dispute sorted out .
qantas is an iconic australian brand , it is the employer of thousands of australians , thousands of people rely on it for their livelihoods and we do need this dispute to be brought to an end , she said .
beginning monday , the airline will lock out all employees involved in the dispute , he said .
the grounding will have a daily financial impact of about 20 million australian dollars ( $ 21.4 million ) , qantas said .
customers booked on qantas flights should not go to the airport until further notice , the airline said .
it will offer travelers full refunds or the chance to rebook .
however , flights with subsidiaries , including jetstar and qantaslink , are not affected .
it 's a maniacal overreaction , said richard woodward , vice president of the australian and international pilots union .
the decision to ground the qantas fleet , stranding thousands of passengers around the world , was unnecessary and grossly irresponsible , he said in a statement .
qantas , which has its headquarters in sydney , is the second oldest airline in the world , and marked its 90th anniversary last year .
it employs about 32 , 500 people and flies to more than 180 destinations worldwide , according to the company website .
the israeli air force struck several sites that it suspected were terror centers sunday , as the wave of back - and - forth attacks between the israeli military and palestinian militants continued .
the air force said the sunday attacks targeted three suspected rocket launching sites and one terror tunnel in northern gaza ; and two terror activity sites in southern gaza .
there was no word from the palestinian sides whether the strikes caused casualties .
the violence began when two islamic jihad commanders were among seven militants killed saturday by israeli strikes targeting a training camp in rafah , gaza , a spokesman for the militant group and medical sources reported .
the israeli military said more than 20 mortars and rockets were subsequently fired into their territory .
a 55 - year - old man was killed in the rocket attacks and 20 others were injured , according to zaki heler , an emergency services spokesman in israel .
palestinian medical sources told cnn that two people were killed in a second wave of israeli airstrikes , launched in response to these rocket attacks .
according to abu ahmed , a spokesman for the islamic jihad , the original israeli strikes occurred during a graduation ceremony .
two other members of his organization were injured in that attack , he said .
witnesses reported that at least 10 other people were wounded .
militias from the libyan city of misrata have beaten and killed displaced residents from the nearby town of tawergha , accusing them of siding with pro - gadhafi forces and committing violent crimes in misrata , according to a report by human rights watch .
local authorities and misrata residents widely accuse tawerghans of having committed serious crimes - including murders and rapes - in misrata with forces loyal to ousted libyan leader moammar gadhafi , human rights watch said .
the group said pro - gadhafi forces used tawergha as a base for attacks on misrata and the surrounding area from march until august .
many tawerghans supported the 42 - year ruler , whose regime claimed that libyan opposition fighters would enslave tawerghans if they took power , human rights watch said .
the group said tawergha - once a town of 30 , 000 residents - is now abandoned , with some areas ransacked and burned .
most of the tawerghans interviewed by the group said they had fled in mid - august , when libyan opposition forces entered the town .
militias quickly forced out those who remained , the group said .
they came outside my house and told us we had to leave our homes , 80 - year - old muhammad grayra tawergi , a retired date farmer , told the rights group .
we were unarmed .
human rights watch called for libya 's new leadership - the national transitional council - to bring central control and accountability to the more than 100 armed groups from misrata .
revenge against the people from tawergha , whatever the accusations against them , undermines the goal of the libyan revolution , sarah leah whitson , middle east and north africa director of human rights watch said in a statement .
in the new libya , tawerghans accused of wrongdoing should be prosecuted based on the law , not subject to vigilante justice .
at least 17 people were killed in central kabul on saturday when a suicide bomber struck a vehicle in a military convoy , according to officials .
five troops and eight civilians were killed in the attack , nato 's international security assistance force said .
afghan officials said four afghans , including two students , were also killed .
among the dead was master corporal byron greff , a canadian , according to the canadian expeditionary force command .
it was not immediately clear whether he was included in the isaf - provided figure .
the u.s. official emphasized details are continuing to unfold .
a heavily damaged vehicle was believed to be an armored bus that was carrying u.s. troops from one base to another .
a senior nato official identified it as a custom - built , heavily armored rhino .
the attack caused a number of nato and local afghan casualties , isaf said in a statement .
four afghans , including two students , were also killed , said hashmat stanikzai , spokesman for kabul 's police chief .
afghan president hamid karzai offered his sympathies to the families of the victims in a statement and said the cowardly character of the attack demonstrates the very evil and heinous nature of the enemy .
a taliban spokesman confirmed saturday 's attack in a text message , saying it killed 16 foreign soldiers , one civilian and injured many others .
taliban casualty counts are often inflated ; there was no other reliable indication 16 foreigners were killed .
a gunman wearing an afghan army uniform turned his weapon on coalition forces during training , killing three and wounding several others , isaf said .
the shooter was killed in the incident in southern afghanistan .
i am both saddened and outraged by the attacks that took place today against coalition forces and the people of afghanistan , allen said in a statement .
the enemies of peace are not martyrs , but murderers .
to hide the fact that they are losing territory , support , and the will to fight , our common enemy continues to employ suicide attackers to kill innocent afghan fathers , mothers , sons and daughters , as well as the coalition forces who have volunteered to protect them .
the u.s. - led war in afghanistan marked its 10th year earlier this month having passed two major milestones .
the taliban has been forced out of power and osama bin laden is dead .
but afghanistan has been hit by a wave of high - profile attacks in recent months that have jeopardized the peace negotiations .
september 's turban bomb assassination of former afghan president burhanuddin rabbani , revered by many as a father of the mujahedeen movement that ousted the soviets in the 1980 s , appears to have dealt the biggest blow to the peace process .
rabbani was the chairman of president karzai 's high council for peace , which has been trying for a year to foster dialogue with the taliban - a strategy that karzai publicly abandoned following rabbani 's killing .
nearly 2 , 800 troops from the united states and its partners have died during the 10 years of war , according to a cnn count .
thirty - five people were in the xialiuchong coal mine in hengyang , which is part of hunan province , when the blast happened around 6 p.m. saturday , according to xinhua .
authorities soon launched a rescue operation , helping six miners get out and transporting them to a hospital for treatment , authorities told the official news agency .
dozens of emergency vehicles , including ambulances and police cars , were on the scene overnight saturday .
some of the miners family members waiting at the site periodically erupted in tears as the night unfolded .
mining accidents are not uncommon in china , as few mines follow government safety regulations .
according to the state administration of coal mine safety , almost 2 , 500 miners were killed in mine accidents in 2010 .
according to xinhua , xialiuchong coal mine is state - owned and has been in operation for 40 years .
it is legally operated , with more than 160 miners typically on site .
the number killed in a huge earthquake that rocked eastern turkey last weekend climbed to 582 saturday , turkish state - run anatolia news agency said , as the government drew up a new law that would move homes from high - risk areas .
deputy prime minister besir atalay said saturday 231 people have been found alive in the wreckage , anatolia reported , despite temperatures dropping close to freezing at night .
atalay said 84 buildings had collapsed in ercis and six in the city of van .
search efforts will continue at four apartment buildings in ercis until the end of the day , the agency quoted him as saying .
two teenagers were pulled alive out of the rubble of apartment buildings late thursday and early friday , more than 100 hours after the quake .
relief crews have distributed 40 , 721 tents - including 6 , 088 from abroad - and 159 , 360 blankets to survivors , authorities said .
a total of 1 , 309 aftershock quakes have occurred since sunday 's main temblor , officials said .
turkey 's government plans to present a new law to parliament by the end of december which would see the evacuation of settlements in areas at high risk of natural disaster , anatolia reported .
laws governing construction and property management would also be revised under the so - called urban transformation law , the agency said .
u.s. defense secretary leon panetta ordered the u.s. european command to provide humanitarian relief supplies including blankets , cots , sleeping bags and hygiene kits , the pentagon said friday .
meanwhile , the chinese government is to send $ 1 million to turkey and the red cross society of china has donated $ 50 , 000 , xinhua quoted a chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman as saying .
south sudanese rebels launched an attack in oil - rich unity state that killed 39 people , a spokesman for that fledgling government said saturday .
yein matthew , the government spokesman , said the attacks in mayom were carried out against civilians by militias of the south sudan liberation army .
since then , the world 's newest nation has been challenged by a number of rebel militias .
led by former officers of the southern army that fought khartoum in a 22 - year civil war , the militias have taken up arms against their former comrades for various reasons .
the south sudan liberation army , for instance , has said that it is fighting corruption and domination of dinkas , the new nation 's main ethnic group .
south sudanese president salva kiir has offered amnesty deals to the rebels .
several truces have not been honored , according to the enough project , which seeks to end genocide and crimes against humanity .
considered an elder statesman , the irish labour party candidate - turned - president elect is a former government minister .
he is to be ireland 's ninth head of state and is scheduled to be inaugurated on november 11 , one day after president mary mcaleese leaves office .
mcguinness 's campaign had been dogged by questions about his past ties to the ira , an armed group that fought against british authorities in northern ireland but has since renounced violence .
he had been consistently third in opinion polls , while businessman and reality tv star sean gallagher had been vying alongside higgins for the top spot .
critics blamed gallagher 's performance in the country 's final televised debate for his collapse in the polls .
mcguinness is expected to return to his role as northern ireland 's deputy first minister .
the long counting process started friday with higgins confirmed as the winner late saturday .
at least 10 people are dead in gaza and southern israel , in a wave of back - and - forth attacks between the israeli military and palestinian militants , according to medical and military officials .
the violence began when two islamic jihad commanders were among seven militants killed saturday by israeli strikes targeting a training camp in rafah , gaza , a spokesman for the militant group and medical sources reported .
the israel defense forces said that more than 20 mortars and rockets were subsequently fired into their territory .
a 55 - year - old man was killed in the rocket attacks and 20 others were injured , according to zaki heler , an emergency services spokesman in israel .
palestinian medical sources told cnn that two people were killed in a second wave of israeli airstrikes , launched in response to these rocket attacks .
according to abu ahmed , a spokesman for the islamic jihad , the original israeli strikes occurred during a graduation ceremony .
two other members of his organization were injured in that attack , he said .
witnesses reported that at least 10 other people were wounded .
israeli police spokesman micky rosenfeld said that one of the rockets then fired from gaza into southern israel struck a building in ashdod .
an israeli man in gan yavne was slightly injured by shrapnel .
an israel defense forces spokesman said it targeted a terrorist group in southern gaza that was preparing to fire long - range rockets into israel .
the spokesman would not name the group , but said it was part of a larger organization .
the idf said in a statement that its forces continued to respond to threats from the gaza strip on saturday night , targeting armed rocket launching tripods and people preparing to launch rockets into israel .
the israeli airstrikes targeted the same group responsible for recent rocket attacks on the israeli port city of ashdod , according to the israeli military spokesman .
former brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva will begin chemotherapy in the coming days to treat a malignant tumor in his larynx , a hospital official said saturday .
this is a localized tumor , noted bogea , meaning that it has not spread elsewhere in the body .
she added that the tumor has not metastasized , a characteristic of most cancerous cells .
finance minister guido mantega told reporters that he attended lula 's birthday party last week and noticed that his voice sounded hoarse .
on saturday , mantega predicted lula would beat cancer .
he noted that former first lady marisa leticia has been with lula ever since he came to the hospital for a check - up on friday .
he is a fighter , mantega told reporters , adding he expected lula will leave the hospital later saturday .
he has overcome lesser obstacles and will overcome this one as well .
founded in 1921 by syrian and lebanese immigrants , the facility 's staff has also treated paraguay 's president fernando lugo and former brazilian vice president jose alencar , who died in march after a long battle against abdominal cancer .
its patients also include current brazilian president dilma rousseff - lula 's handpicked successor and is the first woman to hold the presidency - who was treated in 2005 for lymphoma .
as you all know , i went through the same thing , with the competent team of the syrian - lebanese hospital , which allowed me to completely recover , she said .
i am sure the same thing will happen to president lula .
he is widely credited with helping steer the nation into becoming an economic powerhouse , leaving office last year with high approval ratings .
presidents , however , are barred from running for a third consecutive term .
as the dust settled after the latest agreement was struck to solve the eurozone debt crisis , french president nicolas sarkozy admitted it had been a mistake to admit the stricken greeks into the monetary union .
when lula turned 66 years - old last thursday , he addressed the brazilian public via the internet , saying that he had dedicated more than half his half to improving brazil 's democracy .
greece came into the euro with numbers that were false and its economy was not prepared to assume an integration into the eurozone .
it was a decision that was taken in , i believe , 2001 , for which we now are paying the consequence .
wednesday 's agreement , reached in brussels , will slash greek debt , recapitalize european banks and more than double the european union bailout fund 's resources to handle future sovereign defaults .
it 's great news that we 've got an agreement , said deutsche bank economist gilles moec .
when europe puts its heads together , they do actually begin to cooperate .
china has welcomed the eu summit consensus , whose main elements include a 50 % reduction in the value of greek government bonds , steps recapitalize european banks and plans to attract capital for the already overburdened european financial stability facility rescue fund , in order to reduce greek debt from the current astronomical 160 % of its current economy to 120 % of total economic output over the next 10 years .
we believe that , as the largest economy in the world , the steady , sound , and healthy growth of the eu economy and the eurozone is vital to the world economy 's recovery , foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said at a regular press briefing on thursday .
we are also ready to work with the eu to overcome the difficulty .
but chinese support would depend on europe 's ability to guarantee the safety of any investment , li daokui , a member of china 's central bank monetary policy committee , told the financial times .
it is in china 's long - term and intrinsic interest to help europe because they are our biggest trading partner but the chief concern of the chinese government is how to explain this decision to our own people , li said .
europe hopes to attract capital from sovereign wealth funds , particularly from developing nations like china and russia , to supplement the 440 billion rescue fund , but analysts note that the structure of these investments remains unknown .
in a phone conversation with sarkozy on thursday , chinese president hu jintao made no mention of specific plans to invest in the scheme , but lauded europe 's progress in solving the debt crisis .
the leaders discussed plans for the upcoming g20 summit , with hu saying the annual meeting had become a platform for cleaning up the global economy and that he hopes it can continue to adhere to the spirit of cooperation and common success , china 's state - run xinhua news agency reported .
it is not in china 's interest to fund this scheme , carl weinberg , chief economist at high frequency economics told cnn money .
it is better advised to sit this out and buy assets at liquidation than to invest in a sinking ship .
meanwhile the eu 's bailout fund chief klaus regling will meet with officials in beijing and tokyo friday , though no reason has been given for his visit .
in the sunday telegraph interview , mr assad said western countries are going to ratchet up the pressure , definitely .
syria is the hub now in this region .
it is the faultline , and if you play with the ground you will cause an earthquake , he said , .
any problem in syria will burn the whole region .
if the plan is to divide syria , that is to divide the whole region .
president assad admitted that many mistakes had been made by his security forces in the early part of the uprising , but the paper said he insisted that only terrorists were now being targeted .
we 've been fighting the muslim brotherhood since the 1950 s and we are still fighting with them , he said .
the latest statement from un secretary - general ban ki - moon said mr assad must respond to demands for change with serious reform , not repression and violence , and called for an immediate halt to military operations .
his calls echo those of members of the arab league who on friday sent an urgent message to the syrian government , denouncing the continued killings of civilians taking part in protests .
the league 's ministerial committee on the syrian crisis also urged damascus to take the necessary measures to protect civilians .
on saturday , two of the country 's main activist groups , the british - based syrian observatory for human rights and the local co - ordinating committees , said shells slammed into the baba amr district of homs .
reuters news agency reported one person was shot dead by a sniper and two were killed during machinegun fire between mr assad 's forces and defectors in the city .
activists said that 21 civilians had been killed on saturday , including 12 in hama and three in homs .
in another incident near homs , up to 20 syrian soldiers were killed and 53 wounded in clashes with presumed army deserters , according to agence france presse .
in a separate incident , 10 security agents and a deserter were killed in a bus ambush near the turkish border , afp reported , quoting activists .
the observatory said the bus was transporting security agents between the villages of al - habit and kafrnabuda in idlib province when it was ambushed by armed men , probably deserters .
the two technology firms are not the only ones exploring the area .
less well known companies , including qualcomm and extreme reality 3 d , have also acted to secure touchless control patent rights .
it 's interesting that so many companies are actually investing some very serious time and money into it , said chris green , a technology analyst at davies murphy group .
apple 's filing , entitled real time video process control using gestures , describes controlling images on a device , such as an iphone , without touching it , and the ability to transfer the pictures to one of the firm 's other products using contact - free hand movements .
it suggests infrared , optical and other sensors would be used to detect the movements .
one use could be to transfer a video from a mobile phone by flicking it to a television .
say you 're browsing a tv app on your phone and you found a programme you wanted to record , you could literally - just with a wave - take that programme and throw it to the other device using a gesture rather than using a bluetooth or cable connection , said mr green .
the firm 's former chief executive , steve jobs , appears to have hinted at the prospect to his biographer .
walter issacson wrote : he very much wanted to do for television sets what he had done for computers , music players , and phones : make them simple and elegant .
mr isaacson quoted mr jobs as saying : it will have the simplest user interface you could imagine .
i finally cracked it .
microsoft 's kinect system has been widely praised for its accuracy and clarity , and even university research departments are using the kinect devices , hacking them and using them for their projects , said mr green .

in early april , jon corzine was in a tough spot .
mf global , the company he had run for the previous year , was about to post a fourth - quarter loss , marking its fourth successive fiscal year of red ink .
for the former goldman sachs chief , it was a setback to his efforts to turn mf global around .
he needed his traders to step up their game , and he called a group of them into a conference room at its manhattan headquarters to lay out the plan .
he had just announced a plan for the bank to boost trading risk by holding more assets on its books , both to help customers and to bet on markets .
the trading , particularly in debt from troubled euro zone nations in the past year , has instead driven the firm to the brink of collapse , making it possibly the most prominent u.s. casualty yet from the euro zone crisis .
it has also badly hurt corzine 's business image , and reduced the former new jersey governor 's chances of ever making a political comeback .
corzine could not be reached for comment and mf global declined comment .
the firm was in talks with possible buyers on sunday , though sources said all options were on the table as it had hired restructuring and bankruptcy advisers .
mf global 's fate has raised questions about whether the 64 - year - old corzine 's affinity for risk - taking has finally caught up to him after a career that took him to the top echelons of wall street and then into politics as a u.s. senator and to the new jersey state governor 's mansion .
corzine still has supporters on wall street who argue he was caught in a perfect storm but his detractors argue there have long been signs that corzine could take imprudent risks .
they point to goldman sachs major trading losses under his watch in 1994 , or when he sustained serious injuries in 2007 as a passenger in a speeding sports utility vehicle while not wearing a seatbelt .
he said in a call with analysts last tuesday that mf global sought to take advantage of dislocations in the sovereign debt market by buying what it saw as relatively low risk paper .
in interviews with more than a dozen former employees and competitors , a portrait emerges of corzine struggling to transform the firm by ramping up risk .
his strategic shift did not sit well with some employees , and came at a time when credit ratings agencies and financial markets are very unforgiving of high - risk strategies .
the business model is n 't what it used to be , said patrick arbor , a former chairman of the chicago board of trade and a long - time executive of a clearing broker .
corzine could have shrunk mf global 's balance sheet or restructured .
with the support of the board - which in a recent regulatory filing applauded corzine 's choice - he embarked on the strategy of transforming the company into what the filing described as a commodities - and capital markets - focused investment bank .
while before , mf global would link buyers up with sellers , or place trades on an exchange , the company would now hold an inventory of securities , potentially sitting on positions for longer , and betting on their price movements .
carrying inventories usually requires more capital .
but it seemed like a good move at a time when larger banks such as goldman were being forced to limit their risk - taking because of increased regulation , according to a company presentation .
brad abelow , a former goldman colleague who served as his chief of staff and treasurer during his new jersey gubernatorial term , was named president and chief operating officer .
other senior people joined , including citigroup fixed income veteran richard moore in london who became the firm 's european head .
corzine also hired hedge fund veteran munir javeri as global head of trading , and to oversee proprietary trading .
in an environment with limited capital and limited distribution , the game is about singles and doubles , because if you go for a home run and miss , you might not live to play another day , said one mf trader who worked before and during corzine 's reign .
there was an enormous misunderstanding of the firm 's assets and reach , he added .
some sales staff complained that the firm was short on risk management , something companies like goldman pride themselves on .
internecine squabbles among traders , salespeople and bankers are common at an investment bank , particularly when massive changes in strategy create internal winners and losers .
but to corzine 's critics , his jump into sectors such as european debt investing brought serious risk .
as of october 25 , the company had about $ 6.3 billion of european sovereign debt from some of the euro zone 's more peripheral and troubled countries , including italy , spain , portugal , ireland and belgium , though not greece .
but mf global 's overall capital levels leave it with little margin for error .
the company 's book equity compares to an eye - popping $ 41.05 billion of assets , which means if the value of mf global 's assets falls more than about 3 percent , the company has wiped out the whole of its equity cushion and is out of business .
even a 1 percent decline could leave it dangerously undercapitalized .
the firm 's leverage was on par with lehman brothers , even if its assets were safer .
the company insisted it was being prudent with its risk taking .
in its most recently quarterly presentation last week , it argued it had low levels of illiquid assets , known as level 3 assets .
it pointed out that european sovereign investments are relatively safe , because they mature relatively soon - by the end of 2012 - and the european financial stability facility backstops these countries through mid 2013 .
i can 't speak to mf global , but if he applied the same process there as he did when was conducting the affairs of government , i have to say he is a thoughtful , careful and prudent businessperson , said steven goldman , who served as corzine 's commissioner of banking and insurance in new jersey from 2006 to 2009 and is now a partner at law firm kramer levin naftalis &amp; frankel .
decisions were never made from the hip .
deploying $ 62 million of his ipo bounty , he campaigned as a democrat dark - horse candidate in primary and general elections for a u.s. senate seat from new jersey .
despite refusing to release his income tax records and gaffes such as when he joked about italians who make cement shoes and were defended by jewish lawyers , he won the election .
after one term in which he made only a modest number of headlines , corzine in 2005 successfully campaigned to become new jersey governor .
he lost his campaign for reelection in 2009 to republican chris christie and a few months later answered the call from flowers , whose private equity firm j . c . flowers had invested $ 300 million in mf global in 2008 , and joined the firm .
while he has many fans on wall street and beyond , some say his business and political careers are unlikely to recover from this latest blow .
whatever the outcome of talks over a sale or a restructuring few see much of a role for corzine in mf global 's future .
but the qantas union ; which has been embroiled in a year - long labor dispute punctuated by rolling walkouts ; was caught flat - footed , as was the government of australian prime minister julia gillard and , of course , tens of thousands of qantas passengers worldwide .
it 's a maniacal overreaction , said richard woodward , vice president of the australian and international pilots union .
i think alan joyce is destroying the brand of qantas ; he 's holding the passengers for ransom as he blackmails the government of australia .
australian assistant treasurer bill shorten labeled the decision a high - handed ambush .
we 're conscious the australian economy has been put at great risk of damage due to the strike , shorten said .
labor relations tribunal fair work australia agreed , ordering an end to the labor dispute to avoid significant damage to the tourism industry .
joyce , a native of ireland , has been ceo of qantas since 2008 , after a five - year tenure as ceo of jetstar .
joyce has been pushing a restructuring that would put more focus on expanding its budget airline operations , start a new premium service outside of australia and cut some long - haul routes .
you will remember that early in the 2008 presidential campaign , barack obama signaled that he was going to have a different foreign policy than george bush - and he chose as his example , iran .
he argued that simply pressuring the country was not a policy and obama offered to talk to iran 's leaders .
well , two years into his presidency , obama 's iran policy looks a lot like george w . bush 's - pressure and more pressure .
the punitive tactics have paid off in some measure .
iran faces economic problems .
but they are also having a perverse impact on the country , as i witnessed last week .
the sanctions are stifling growth , though not as much as one might imagine .
so the basic effect has been to weaken civil society and strengthen the state - the opposite of what we should be trying to do in that country .
by some estimates , iran 's revolutionary guard - the hard - line element of the armed forces , supported by the supreme leader , now controls 40 % of the economy .
in fact , what is our goal ?
is it to overthrow the iranian regime ?
is it to make it bleed until it gives up its nuclear program ?
a wholesale revolution continues to strike me as a distant prospect .
the regime still has some domestic support , and it uses a mix of religious authority , patronage and force quite effectively .
and we keep forgetting the inconvenient fact that , even if the regime changed , the nuclear energy program - which is popular as an expression of iranian nationalism and power - will continue .
even the leaders of the green movement strongly support that program .
obama should return to his original approach and test the iranians to see if there is any room for dialogue and agreement .
engaging with iran , putting its nuclear program under some kind of supervision and finding areas of common interest ( such as afghanistan ) would all be important goals .
it might not work - the iranian regime is divided and often paralyzed itself - but it 's worth trying .
strategic engagement with an adversary can go hand in hand with a policy that encourages change in that country .
that 's how washington dealt with the soviet union and china in the 1970 s and 80 s .
iran is a country of 80 million people , educated and dynamic .
it sits astride a crucial part of the world .
it can not be sanctioned and pressed down forever .
it is the last great civilization to sit outside the global order .
we need a strategy that combines pressure with a path to bring iran in from the cold .

brazil 's government has loudly proclaimed a deal it says is worth $ 12 billion for taiwanese technology giant foxconn to produce ipads and build a whole new industry based around screens used in an array of consumer electronics from smartphones to televisions .
but the infamous brazil cost - shorthand for the bureaucracy and high taxes that plague business in the country - is already overshadowing the deal , complicating negotiations with foxconn over the broader investment plan .
the likely need for large state subsidized loans to lure foxconn also revives concerns about the state 's heavy hand in brazil 's economy .
yet critics say brazil 's shallow labor pool and poor infrastructure make it ill - prepared to make the leap to high - end work and that it risks being stuck at the low end - assembling components designed and made elsewhere .
at first , foxconn will have to fly in most of the key components such as semiconductors , modems and screens from china , as brazil attempts to raise its ability to produce more of them locally .
we are selling our market very cheaply , giving tax incentives for a company to come and produce something that is already developed in the world market , said joao maria de oliveira , a researcher at the government - linked institute for applied economic research , or ipea .
it 's not something that adds much value and it wo n 't leave much here .
the amount of value added to apple products by foxconn 's approximately one million workers in china is a mere $ 10 or so per device , according to a study by researchers at the university of california , irvine .
brazil has cut taxes and duties on tablet production in a move that should reduce the retail price by about a third and is phasing in production requirements to foster a local components industry .
separately , it is in talks with foxconn on a package of incentives , including priority customs access , more tax breaks and subsidized loans from state development bank bndes to secure the bigger investment in high - end screens .
the foxconn factory near steve jobs road is rumored by brazilian media to already be producing iphones and is expected to start churning out ipad tablets by december for sale to brazil 's growing middle class .
the company , whose main listed vehicle is hon hai precision industry co ltd , has already hired more than 1 , 000 people in jundiai , a medium - sized city an hour away from sao paulo , to work at a new plant .
tablet sales in brazil will jump to 450 , 000 this year from 105 , 000 - 110 , 000 last year , according to consulting firm idc , surging to above 1 million next year .
that is significant growth - but the 60 percent of brazilian households without a computer wo n 't necessarily rush out to buy tablets , cautioned jose martim juacida , an analyst with the company .
last week , fareed zakaria traveled to iran to interview president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
fareed 's trip occurred just weeks after the united states accused iran of plotting to assassinate the saudi ambassador to the u.s. and just as president obama announced the upcoming withdrawal of u.s. troops from iraq .
fareed considered the former a sign of iran 's militarization and the latter a strategic boon to tehran .
fareed was in iran at a time when its leadership is locked in an internal power struggle with president ahmadinejad up against supreme leader ayatollah khamenei .
this has led one gps analyst to ask whether ahmadinejad will effectively be iran 's last president .
and as the winds of change sweep the arab world , they seem to stop at iran 's borders .
here are some reasons why there has n 't been an iranian spring ' .
but clearly discontent bubbles within .
just look at this surprising bestselling book in tehran .
fareed found iran surprisingly clean and its urban women relatively liberated .
he spoke with analysts in iran who explained why , despite what westerners might expect , ahmadinejad is actually a reformer when compared with the ayatollah .
and fareed saw the effect of sanctions up close .
the interview with president ahmadinejad was striking as well .
the president offered a rather unique interpretation of zionism , proposed an odd political experiment and defended his country 's soft policies toward syria .
as expected , he denied iran 's nuclear weapons ambitions and condemned the united states for myriad alleged wrongs .
and ahmadinejad argued that nato 's mission in libya exacerbated the conflict .
we 've been paying a lot of attention to iran over the past few weeks .
you can read all our coverage here .
in the coming days , we 'll be presenting some broader analytical pieces to make sense of it all .
i invite you to join us in sharing your impressions and analyses below .
i was in saudi arabia when king fahd died in 2005 .
there was genuine remorse among saudis young and old at the passing of the king .
portraits of the king covered car windows for weeks - a spontaneous and unprecedented outburst of saudi national grief .
there was also hope that the new king , abdullah , would help bring saudi arabia into the twenty - first century .
that dream ended yesterday with the appointment of prince nayef bin abdul aziz as crown prince , or de facto ruler of saudi arabia as king abdullah continues to undergo hospital treatment for his declining health condition .
in the corridors of power in washington , dc , and london there was some relief that prince nayef , as expected , had become crown prince .
in contrast , young saudis on twitter , saudi democracy activists and vocal women were filled with foreboding as to what lies ahead in their country .
granted , nayef has been a vociferous enemy of al qaeda elements inside saudi arabia and eliminated hundreds of operatives , while arresting thousands since 2003 .
but this was not because he opposed jihadi ideology or islamist thinking .
his public attacks on the muslim brotherhood come not because he differs with their brand of salafi islam , but because they seek to undermine the house of saud .
the general conference for unesco gets underway in paris monday when the u.n. agency is expected to vote whether or not to accept a palestinian bid for full membership .
in september , palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas made a bid for the united nations to recognize a palestinian state .
and unesco is the first agency that the palestinians have sought to join .
any recognition of palestine as a member state would not only jeopardize the hope for a resumption of direct israeli - palestinian negotiations , but would endanger the united states contribution to unesco , said an october 13 letter signed by members of the house appropriations subcommittee on state and foreign operations , which appropriates unesco 's u.s. funding .
this is consistent with current law and i will consider additional actions as needed , she said this month .
there are consequences for short - cutting the process , not only for the palestinians , but for our longstanding relationship with the united nations .
she was referring to a provision of 22 usc 287 e which states : no funds authorized to be appropriated by this act or any other act shall be available for the united nations or any specialized agency thereof which accords the palestine liberation organization the same standing as member states .
a humanitarian crisis looms in thailand after the worst floods in decades left parts of bangkok and other areas of the country submerged , relief agencies warned sunday .
bangkok 's central business district has so far avoided major flooding , but many of the areas nearby are chest - or waist - deep in water , forcing residents to flee their homes .
the thai government has set up more than 1 , 700 shelters across the country , where more than 113 , 000 people have taken refuge since flooding began in july after heavy monsoon rains .
more than 370 people have died , and charities working in the country have warned of the risk of water - and insect - borne diseases such as diarrhea , dengue fever and malaria in the coming days and weeks .
thai officials warned residents in the capital to be vigilant and expect disruptions with electricity and tap water .
unicef said it was providing 20 , 000 mosquito nets , and handing out 20 , 000 pamphlets explaining how to stay safe and healthy in flood - hit regions .
the red cross said it had provided more than 130 , 000 relief kits , and 120 , 000 packs of bottled water , but representatives in bangkok said they were concerned at the lack of food and drinking water in communities isolated by the floodwaters .
officials in the capital have warned residents to expect interruptions to electricity and tap water supplies .
the metropolitan waterworks authority said it had reduced the amount of tap water processed for residents from 900 , 000 to 400 , 000 cubic meters per day , because of high algae counts at one of its plants .
the prime minister said authorities would speed up the process of draining water into bangkok 's canals and into the sea , raising hopes that water levels in the city could start to sink .
however , the government has warned it may take more than a month for the floods to recede .
cochrane said the country still faced a variety of threats , including strong currents , disease and even crocodile and snake attacks .
but he said it was vital that authorities and charities also start to look beyond the immediate dangers .
three afghan security guards and one afghan civilian were killed in the attack , said gen . hamid wardag , a local commander of the afghan national army .
in addition , two assailants were shot to death by afghan security forces , the general said .
wardag said a truck full of explosives blew up in front of the international relief and development office .
the explosion was followed by gunfire .
some armed taliban have taken position at the building at this moment and are fighting back , wardag said monday morning .
a few hours later , wardag said the shooting had stopped , but a search for gunmen continued inside the building .
international relief and development specializes in helping areas affected by conflict and war recover and improve , according to its website .
kandahar province has seen a rash of recent violence .
on thursday , insurgents launched attacks on a provincial reconstruction team base and a military outpost , afghan and nato officials said .
insurgents fired small guns and rocket - propelled grenades ( rpgs ) toward the provincial reconstruction team , said agha lali , a member of the kandahar provincial council .
officials killed two of the attackers , according to a regional police chief .
and on october 22 , three u.s. service members were killed when an improvised explosive device blew up near their assault force .
after seven months of an aerial bombing campaign that helped depose longtime ruler moammar gadhafi , nato officially ends its mission in libya on monday .
nato 's move comes after the united nations security council last week rescinded its march mandate for military intervention to protect civilians targeted during anti - regime protests .
libyans have now liberated their country and they have transformed the region , said nato secretary - general anders fogh rasmussen on friday .
this is their victory .
our operation for libya will end on october 31 .
until then , together with our partners , we will continue to monitor the situation .
and if needed , we will continue to respond to threats to civilians , rasmussen said .
we 're very concerned that , as we move forward , that the authorities make maximum effort to swiftly form an inclusive government that incorporates all aspects of libyan society , and in which the rights of all libyan people are fully and thoroughly respected , regardless of their gender , their religion , their region of origin , rice said after the security council vote last thursday .
all of the events that have taken place since february 2011 and the murder of gadhafi , all of this means we are totally in our right to call upon the international criminal court , said marcel ceccaldi , a lawyer representing the family said last week .
nato 's libya campaign began in march , after the security council adopted resolution 1973 , which imposed a no - fly zone in the country 's airspace and authorized member states to take measures to protect civilians .
the trial of former egyptian president hosni mubarak was put on hold for two months pending a decision on whether to replace the judge , his lawyer told cnn on sunday .
the delay comes because attorneys for victims of the uprising that toppled mubarak objected to the judge presiding over the case , said the lawyer , farid el deeb .
the judge is not firm enough , said khaled abu bakr , a lawyer representing one of the victims .
he did not allow many of them into the court and did not give them enough time to ask their questions , especially in the testimony of general tantawi .
they face charges over the killing of protesters in the demonstrations that led mubarak to resign in february , and over corruption while in office .
lawyers representing the families of the dead protesters petitioned a higher court demanding a new panel of judges because of unfair treatment of lawyers representing civilians .
japan 's ministry of finance intervened in the currency market for the first time since august to weaken the yen , sending the currency down as much as 5.1 per cent against the us dollar .
jun azumi , finance minister , confirmed that the bank of japan was acting on the mof 's orders to halt the yen 's speculative rise , after the currency touched 75.35 , a new postwar high , earlier in the day .
the japanese currency climbed last week even as the boj eased monetary policy , increasing the size of its asset - purchasing programme by 10 per cent , and in spite of economic data from the us that were mostly encouraging .
the action had an immediate effect , sending the yen down to 79.49 .
masafumi yamamoto , chief currency strategist at barclays capital , said the traditional correlation between the dollar / yen rate and us - japan yield gaps had broken down in recent weeks , suggesting that the direction of the currency was not being steered by fundamentals .
to some extent , [ today 's action ] fills the gap between the actual dollar / yen level and the rational level suggested by yield differentials , said yunosuke ikeda , head of fx strategy at nomura .
still , the timing of the move came as a surprise to some , given that the nikkei index and yen crosses had both been relatively steady .
this is likely to have been a single - shot intervention .
repeated currency intervention is likely to be regarded as currency manipulation , which is not allowed under the g7 framework , said mr ikeda .
in recent cases of intervention , the government 's style has been minimum frequency , but maximum size , said mr yamamoto of barcap .
if today 's intervention stops the downward movement in dollar / yen , there will be no follow - through tomorrow , but it all depends on how the currency moves in later sessions .
nine americans , including four u.s. troops , were among those killed in a suicide bombing in afghanistan 's capital this weekend , a western diplomat told cnn sunday .
saturday 's blast - which also claimed the lives of two british civilians , a kosovo national and a canadian soldier - occurred when a car packed with explosives struck an armored bus in a nato convoy , the diplomat said .
authorities have not released identities of the other victims .
a diplomatic source said the two british citizens who were killed were civilian contractors working for isaf .
afghan president hamid karzai offered his sympathies at a national security meeting sunday .
afghan people are grieved by the nato loss of lives and share the pain and sorrow with the families and friends of the troops killed , he said .
a taliban spokesman confirmed saturday 's attack in a text message , saying it killed 16 foreign soldiers , one civilian and injured many others .
taliban casualty counts are often inflated ; there was no other reliable indication 16 foreigners were killed .
attackers fired rocket - propelled grenades and small arms at coalition troops who were assisting afghan forces at the site of a land dispute , the statement said .
no isaf forces were injured or killed , the statement said .
the fighting erupted after the taliban convinced members of a tribe that they should attack a convoy carrying government officials to reclaim their land , said haji lewani , a tribal elder in the province .
about 20 taliban insurgents and seven tribesmen were among the dead , he said .
also saturday , a gunman wearing an afghan army uniform turned his weapon on coalition forces during training , killing three and wounding several others , isaf said .
the shooter was killed in the incident in southern afghanistan .
an unmanned russian rocket successfully lifted off with a cargo of supplies for the crew of the international space station on sunday , two months after a similar rocket crashed in siberia .
the progress 45 freighter is slated to dock with the station on wednesday with three tons of food , fuel , water and spare parts for the u.s. , russian and japanese crew of the station .
the vessel took off from russia 's baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan at 4 : 11 p.m. ( 6 : 11 a.m. et ) and reached its preliminary orbit in nine minutes , the u.s. space agency nasa said .
the launch follows a failed launch in august , when another progress crashed into the siberian wilderness .
it was the first such crash in the craft 's 30 - year service history , but space officials said the station 's three - member crew was never in any danger of running out of food or water .
in a written statement , nasa 's manned space flight chief , bill gerstenmaier , said the launch sets the stage for the next scheduled crew rotation aboard the iss in november .
